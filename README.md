# SHA-256 

Welcome to the SHA-256 repository! This project focuses on the Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit, commonly known as SHA-256. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function widely used for data integrity verification and secure storage.

## Introduction

SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family of hash functions, designed by the National Security Agency (NSA). It produces a fixed-size 256-bit hash value, making it suitable for various cryptographic applications.

## Features

### 1. Data Integrity

SHA-256 ensures the integrity of data by generating a unique hash value for any given input. Even a small change in the input data results in a significantly different hash, making it easy to detect alterations.

### 2. Cryptographic Security

SHA-256 is considered secure for various cryptographic purposes, including digital signatures and certificate generation. It is resistant to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash.

### 3. Password Hashing

The hash function is commonly employed for secure password hashing. When storing passwords, it's a good practice to hash them using SHA-256 to protect user credentials.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to start using SHA-256 in your projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnayaChoudhari/comps.git
